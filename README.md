# SQL--Employee-Tracker

**Version 1.0.0**

## Description 
The purpose of this project was to build relational tables using mysql and then query those tables given a user's requests captured through inquirer to return that data in the commandline.

## Significant Changes
Changes were made to update tables given a users input. Helper functions were used for dynamically displaying queried values. Those values were then used to find equivalent id's. Global arrays were used to store queried data within the helperFunctions.js file.

## Challenges
The biggest challenge was dynamically providing queried database in inquirer and then converting that text to the associated id for updating of the record. This was the bulk of the architectural challenge. Though it wasn't prescribed as a necessity to accomplish this project painstaking hours were spent engineering an effective way to go about this.

## Credits
This project utilized no outside research efforts outside the scope of our course to engineer a solution. All credits belong to the honor of this repository.
